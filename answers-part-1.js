  // == and === both are used to check equality, but == doesn't checks the datatype of the values but === is strictly equal thus it checks the datatype of values as well
  // for example 
  console.log("2"==2);   // this will show me true but as you can see here onle value is string and one is integer thus this shows that == doesn't checks the datatypes of the values
  console.log("2"===2);  // this will on the other hand will show false as it also checks the datatypes of the values and as the datatypes of both the values are different it is not equal it is also known as "strictly equal operator"
