# Exercise 1: Object Manipulation

// Create an object called 'student' with properties 'name', 'age', and 'grade'.
// Set the values accordingly and log the entire object.
// Update the 'grade' property to 'B' and log the updated object.

// Your code here:
# Exercise 2: Function with Callback

// Write a function called 'performOperation' that takes two numbers and a callback function as parameters.
// The callback function should perform an operation (e.g., add, subtract, multiply, divide) on the two numbers.
// Call the 'performOperation' function with different callback functions.

// Your code here:
# Exercise 3: Array Manipulation

// Create an array named 'colors' with at least 5 color names.
// Use array methods to add two more colors to the beginning of the array and two more colors to the end of the array.
// Log the final 'colors' array.

// Your code here:
# Exercise 4: Conditional Logic

// Write a function called 'weatherStatus' that takes a temperature as a parameter.
// Return 'It's hot!' if the temperature is greater than 30, 'It's warm.' if it's between 20 and 30 (inclusive),
// and 'It's cold!' if it's less than 20.
// Call the function with different temperature values.

// Your code here:
